- [x] MLP (Multi-layer perception)

- [x] Convolutional Network

### The tutorials on computer vision:

- [x] Classification with CNN

- [x] Object detection with CNN

- [x] Object Detection with FCN (Fully Convolutional Network)

- [x] Optimization on networks

### The tutorials on reinforcement learning:

- [x] Value and policy

- [x] Q learning and Deep Q learning

- [x] Tricks on game state search

### The tutorials on data analysis:

- [x] Data properties and concepts on feature domain.
