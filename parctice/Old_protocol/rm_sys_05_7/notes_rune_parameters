Parameters to be adjusted:
1)bilateralFilter(src, d, sigmaColor, sigmaSpace, borderType[optional] )

## d is the filter size(preferably <=5 for realtime, sigmacolor ,sigmaspace, for simplicity
## you can set the 2 sigma values to be the same. if they are small(ie. < 10), the filter will not have much effect. However, if they are large, the filter will have a very strong effect, making the image look cartoonish

sigmaColor	Filter sigma in the color space. A larger value of the parameter means that farther colors within the pixel neighborhood (see sigmaSpace) will be mixed together, resulting in larger areas of semi-equal color.

sigmaSpace	Filter sigma in the coordinate space. A larger value of the parameter means that farther pixels will influence each other as long as their colors are close enough (see sigmaColor ). When d>0, it specifies the neighborhood size regardless of sigmaSpace. Otherwise, d is proportional to sigmaSpace.
